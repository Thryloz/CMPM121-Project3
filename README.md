CMPM121 Third Project Card Game

Patterns Used <br/>
Inheritance - Cards inherit from a Base Card Class, letting it use methods and access common fields such as position without having to rewrite it.<br/>
Singleton - GameManager is a singleton. Technically the player and opponent classes are singletons as well.<br/>
Observer- GameManager also acts as an observer.<br/>
